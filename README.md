# Spatial Light Modulators Module

A module for work with spatial light modulators - SLM (especially transparent liquid crystal based SLM - LC-SLM and Digital Micromirror Device - DMD)

Functionality LC-SLM part:
- generate analytical hologram (light declining and focusing)
- generate general hologram (two algorithms - GS and GD)
- transform hologram - mostly shifting of the image in Fourier plane
- display hologram on external screen (slm) without panels and stuff
- create gif (holografic, expected images, gif from process of hologram generation)
- handling non-uniform incomming intensity
- calibrate optical path containing lc-slm
- make hologram gif for moving traps based on parametrizations of trap paths

Functionality DMD part:
- wait for it...
